# w26-missing-persons

This project empirically tests the “Missing White Woman Syndrome” by analyzing which missing persons cases receive media attention versus who actually goes missing. Using NamUs (National Missing and Unidentified Persons System), members will compile demographic data on every case, then cross-reference with podcasts, news coverage, and social media discourse. 

Disparities that will be investigated include topics such as: What percentage of cases involving white women generate media coverage compared to Black, Indigenous, Latina women, or men of any race? Does age, attractiveness, or socioeconomic status predict coverage? Most importantly, does media attention correlate with case resolution rates, or does it just exploit tragedy without helping families? 

Geographic analysis will reveal whether certain regions’ missing persons get national attention while others remain invisible. This project has implications for resource allocation in law enforcement, media ethics, and understanding how society values different lives differently. 

Final deliverables will include an interactive dashboard showing coverage gaps and a comprehensive report suitable for sharing with journalism organizations or advocacy groups.
